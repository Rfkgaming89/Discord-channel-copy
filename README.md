# Discord-channel-copy

Overview
This is a simple Discord bot that copies all messages from one channel and posts them to another channel using a copy command.

Installation

Clone or download the project to your local machine.

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal or command prompt.

Open the config.py file and enter your bot token, the ID of the channel to copy from, and the ID of the channel to copy to.

Run python bot.py to start the bot.

Usage

To use the bot, type the copy command (default is !copy) in the channel where you want to copy messages from. 

The bot will copy the 10 most recent messages from that channel and post them in the channel you specified in the configuration.

You can change the copy command and the number of messages to copy by modifying the COPY_COMMAND and COPY_LIMIT variables in the bot.py file.
